											<h3>Advanced Elective Module ALP Session under Digital Manipulation (Secondary 2)</h3>
											<p>In Secondary 2, We had a elective module during ALP which me and my team chose to focus in Digital Manipulation. After our outstanding work and presentation, we were elected under the Advanced Elective Module for Digital Manipulation. Only 1 to 2 groups were chosen per class. During the course, we were trained by professional designers through programmes such as photoshop. I still feel very proud of my team and our ability to work together to achieve such a feet</p>

										<h3>Position of Vice President in IMTC(Secondary 3 to 4)</h3>
										<p>The moment I stepped into school and discovered the Infocomm Media and Technology Club, I was captivated by their coding and robotics module. Joining it as a CCA fascinated me, unlocking a whole new world of coding. Throughout my years in secondary school, I enthusiastically volunteered for numerous events, embracing roles like a photographer, PA team member, and backstage support. I felt a genuine sense of pride in my work, continuously honing my leadership abilities. In secondary 3, my seniors and teachers officially elected me as the vice-president and director of infocomm. Taking up this responsibility filled me with immense pride as I could showcase my talents and guide my juniors, empowering them to explore the exciting realm of technology.</p>
										<p>Being a weekly team leader was an incredible experience that filled me with a mix of pride and responsibility. Overseeing the school's sound and visual system, I dedicated myself to ensuring flawless mornings with a smoothly running sound system. It was a joy to take my juniors under my wing, sharing my knowledge and passion for the PA system, and witnessing their growth as they mastered its nuances.
											During our CCA sessions, I felt an overwhelming sense of fulfillment as I guided my juniors through workshops, imparting new skills and watching their enthusiasm flourish. </p>
										<h3>Colours Award (Secondary 4)</h3>
										<p>As my tenure as the director drew to a close, I was humbled and elated to be recognized alongside my fellow presidents, receiving the prestigious Jurong West Secondary School Colours Award for our unwavering dedication to the school and our leadership contributions to the CCA. These moments have left an indelible mark on my heart, reminding me of the joy and fulfillment found in mentoring others and serving as a leader in my school community.</p>

	<h3><a href="https://www.sgcodecampus.com/datascience-accelerator/">AWS Accelerator 2022 (Secondary 3 to 4) </a> </h3>
	<p>The AWS Accelerator programme serves as an introduction to Machine/Deep Learning capabilities within Amazon Web Service cloud. I feel immensely honored to be the sole student from my school participating in the AWS Accelerator 2022 programme, having met all the requirements and received a nomination. Throughout this journey, my knowledge of coding has expanded significantly, and I now possess the skills to leverage Amazon Web Services to my advantage. Being part of this programme brings me great joy, especially as my team and I have embarked on a thrilling project: developing an NParks GPS wayfinder application from scratch. We aim to create a comprehensive application that provides detailed information and precise park location within one park, and I am excited to contribute to its success. The AWS Accelerator has truly opened doors to exciting possibilities, and I can't wait to see our project come to life.</p>
	<p>I hope to fully compelte the necessary hours required to earn my certificate "AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials", and will continue to stay curious and willing to learn and expand my exisitng knowledge beyond my abilities </p>

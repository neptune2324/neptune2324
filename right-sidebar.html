										<h3>3D Modeling, Design</h3>
										<p>Designing and building during my free time is an incredibly fulfilling and therapeutic pursuit for me. There's an indescribable joy that comes from bringing my ideas to life and witnessing the gradual progress of buildings and designs taking shape before my eyes. It's like embarking on a creative journey, and with each step, I feel a sense of accomplishment and wonder, knowing that I'm contributing to something unique and meaningful.

											The process of transformation from mere concepts to tangible, majestic structures is awe-inspiring. It's as if I'm breathing life into my imagination, and as the project evolves, I find myself deeply immersed in the intricate details that make it come alive. The combination of artistic expression and technical finesse fuels my passion, and I take great pride in seeing my creations come to fruition.

										<p>Moreover, designing and building offer me an escape from the daily pressures of life. It provides a space where I can immerse myself fully, letting my creativity flow freely. There's a meditative quality to this activity as I lose myself in the craft, forgetting about time and worries. It's a sanctuary where I can explore new ideas, experiment with various materials, and challenge myself to improve constantly.</p>

	<h3>How I have developed as a person</h3>
	<p>Looking back, the contrast between my primary school self and my secondary school self is striking, as they are two distinct and unique individuals. During my younger years, I must admit I was quite stubborn, often causing trouble and being rather reserved. My attention span in class was short, and I was inclined to laziness when it came to completing tasks. However, as I journeyed through secondary school, I've undergone a remarkable transformation, evolving into a more mature and responsible person.

		With time and experience, I've grown in terms of maturity, refining my manners, and developing better social interactions. Sharing my ideas with others has become something I genuinely enjoy, although there are moments of shyness when conversing with those I'm not entirely comfortable with. Nevertheless, with close friends, I can be quite talkative and engaging.
		
		</p>
	<p>One of the most significant changes has been my attitude towards work and studies. I've come to recognize the importance of taking my responsibilities seriously and approaching tasks diligently. I now understand the balance between playtime and focus, knowing when to engage in recreational activities and when to dedicate myself to my studies.</p>

											<h3>Photography</h3>
											<p>Photography is a captivating hobby of mine that allows me to capture the beauty of the world through my lens. It's a way for me to express my creativity, tell stories, and freeze moments in time that hold special meaning to me. Whether it's capturing stunning landscapes, candid portraits, or unique details, photography allows me to see the world with a different perspective and share my vision with others. It's a source of joy and inspiration that continuously fuels my passion for capturing life's precious moments.</p>
